# ILMUSU ENCHANTMENTS MOD
This mod adds <b>more enchantments</b> to Minecraft.  
It also includes a new mechanic, referred to as <b><span style="color:purple">Demonic Enchanting</span></b>, for making enchanting a little bit more interesting without twisting the game too much. Currently, there is no way of disabling this mechanic and I will consider making it possible based on users review.  

## DEMONIC ENCHANTING
While enchanting items or books, you might discover <b><span style="color:purple">demonic enchantments</span></b> :

</p>

These enchantments require, not only experience levels and lapislazuli, but also a <b><span style="color:red">sacrifice</span></b>: this means that around the Enchanting Table (in a radius of 5 blocks) there should be enough living entities to drawn the health requested by the enchantment. For example in the second image, 40 hearts needs to be consumed and a sheep has only 4 hearts, this means that 10 sheeps are necessary to apply the <b><span style="color:purple">demonic enchantment</span></b> on the item.  
Notice that when there are not enough living entities aroung the enchanting table, <b>the health is drawn from the player</b> who might also get killed!  
  
If the health requirement is satisfied, you will obtain the <b><span style="color:purple">demonic enchantment</span></b>:
