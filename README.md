# ILMUSU ENCHANTMENTS MOD
This mod adds <b>more enchantments</b> to Minecraft.  
It also includes a new mechanic, referred to as <b><span style="color:purple">Demonic Enchanting</span></b>, for making enchanting a little bit more interesting without twisting the game too much. Currently, there is no way of disabling this mechanic and I will consider making it possible based on users review.  

## DEMONIC ENCHANTING
While enchanting items or books, you might discover <b><span style="color:purple">demonic enchantments</span></b> :

</p>

These enchantments require, not only experience levels and lapislazuli, but also a <b><span style="color:red">sacrifice</span></b>: this means that around the Enchanting Table (in a radius of 5 blocks) there should be enough living entities to drawn the health requested by the enchantment. For example in the second image, 40 hearts needs to be consumed and a sheep has only 4 hearts, this means that 10 sheeps are necessary to apply the <b><span style="color:purple">demonic enchantment</span></b> on the item.  
Notice that when there are not enough living entities aroung the enchanting table, <b>the health is drawn from the player</b> who might also get killed!  
  
If the health requirement is satisfied, you will obtain the <b><span style="color:purple">demonic enchantment</span></b>:

## NEW ENCHANTMENTS
### LACERATION ENCHANTMENT
The <b><span style="color:purple">Laceration Enchantment</span></b> provides additional damage for weapon tools (similarly to the Sharpness Enchantment). Since it is a demonic enchantment, attacking an entity with an item containing this enchantment will damage also the player: at the maximum level, it will provide +37.5 additional damage and consume 25% of the player maxium health.  

<details>
<summary><b>Details here</b></summary>
This enchantment produces more damage the more the health it can consume from the player. <br />
At level 1, it consumes 10.00% of the player health and produces +6.5 additional damage. <br />
At level 2, it consumes 13.75% of the player health and produces +12.0 additional damage.  <br />
At level 3, it consumes 17.50% of the player health and produces +19.0 additional damage. <br />

At level 5, it consumes 25.00% of the player health and produces +37.6 additional damage. <br />
An important notice is that it never kills the player, <b>leaving him at half a heart</b>. <br />

### UNEARTHING ENCHANTMENT
